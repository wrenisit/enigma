Enigma Project Review

For the project, I feel that my project grades as follows:
Functionality
My command line is running, and does encrypt and write to a file, so I would say that my functionality falls at a 2.75. The decrypt command line does run the file, but the decrypt function does not work. 

Object Oriented Programming
I have 4 classes and a helper module. I know that there is still room for improvement in the classes and in streamlining the methods. I feel that my project would fall between a 3 and a 4 on OOP.

Test Driven Development
I have mocks and stubs in my Encryption Test, but I do not have 100% coverage. If the grade is based only on the coverage of tests, I would have a 2. If the mock and stub is factored in, I would even out to a 3.

Version Control
With over 80 commits and 17 plus pull requests, I would say that my version control falls closer to a 3 or 4. I feel that I have the metrics for a 4, and worked hard to ensure no large chunks of code were committed together, and that pull requests handled single topics or pieces of code only.

Final Thoughts
While there is still quite a bit of room for improvement, I do feel that this shows that I have grown in my skills and knowledge, and that I have a decent grasp on the concepts of Mod 1. I feel that with continued practice, I can further my knowledge, but that I am ready to move on to mod 2.
